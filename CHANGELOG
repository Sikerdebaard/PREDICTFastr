2.0.0 - 2018-02-13
------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Vessel, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), phase, GLCM multislice and NGTDM
  features.
- Groupwise feature selection for these features.
- Function to perform statistical tests among features from classes.
- Selectfrommodel feature selection.
- SGDR, RFR, ElasticNet, and LASSO estimators.
- Option to supply fixed splits to cross validation.
- Option to perform no cross validation, but just a fixed train and test split.
- SMOTE?
- After each cross validation, a temporary save of the results of that
  iteration can optionally be made.
- A lot of explanations/helps to functions.
- Plotting function for regression functions.
- Function to apply student t-test to features.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Parameters of all features computations are now parsed from the configuration
  ini file instead of solely being in the functions.
- Joblib and Fastr SearchCV objects now in single file. Created a general
  SearchCV object.


Fixed
~~~~~

- SVM kernel degree can now also become linear.
- Feature group selection was not working.
- Regression now uses a non-stratified split for cross validation, a stratified
  split is not possible and thus gave errors.
- There was a bug that the coliage features where always computed, which
  is now fixed.
