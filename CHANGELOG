2.0.1 - Unreleased
------------------


Added
~~~~~

- PREDICT Exceptions in general.
- A PREDICT ValueError catch when fitting the classifiers has failed and thus
  output is missing.
- Feature imputation added in fitandscore. Made additions in scripts parsing
  these fields
  towards fitandscore.
- Logistic regression classifier.
- Ensemble performance computing in plot_SVM.
- Feature selection based on variance taking the mean of the features into
  account.
- Added PCA as feature selection method.
- Added plot_feature_groups function. Note that it's not used yet by default in
  the trainclassifier analysis
- Some more docstrings and cleaned some functions.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- LoG features are now computed per 2-D slice, as is done with most other
  features as well.
- SVM parameters slack is now dependent on features.
- Removed normalization in calcfeatures: now in separate node in WORC.
- Moved load_data function from trainclassifier to file_io for broader use.
- Removed preprocessing. It is now part of the WORC Python package and thus a
  step separated from the feature calculation.


Fixed
~~~~~

- The load_data function in trainclassifier didn't work properly for multiple
  modalities.
- LoG filter needs a minimum of 4 voxels in each direction. These are therefore
  now extracted on the full image instead of o nly the ROI slices. Plus there
  is a catch if the full image also does not meet these criteria.
- SMOTE was not working properly in the nocrossval function in the classification/crossval.py script.
- Added ravel of labels to nocrossval function, as it was missing.
- Conversion to numpy uint8 for vessel features, as skimage cannot filter certain float images.
- construct_classifier gives an error for SVM's if a kernel type is not recognized.
- Param grids in construct_crossval were using loc and scale incorrectly.
- NaN in phase images are replaced by zeros to prevent errors.
- In vessel features, when segmentation is small, there is not inner or outer edge.
  PREDICT gave an error, now those features are just zeros.
- In shape_features, first check if (0x18, 0x50) is present in metadata before
  computing volume.
- No more unnecessary use of lists in CalcFeatures and get_features for the image data.

2.0.0 - 2018-02-13
------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Vessel, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), phase, GLCM multislice and NGTDM
  features.
- Groupwise feature selection for these features.
- Function to perform statistical tests among features from classes.
- Selectfrommodel feature selection.
- SGDR, RFR, ElasticNet, and LASSO estimators.
- Option to supply fixed splits to cross validation.
- Option to perform no cross validation, but just a fixed train and test split.
- SMOTE?
- After each cross validation, a temporary save of the results of that
  iteration can optionally be made.
- A lot of explanations/helps to functions.
- Plotting function for regression functions.
- Function to apply student t-test to features.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Parameters of all features computations are now parsed from the configuration
  ini file instead of solely being in the functions.
- Joblib and Fastr SearchCV objects now in single file. Created a general
  SearchCV object.


Fixed
~~~~~

- SVM kernel degree can now also become linear.
- Feature group selection was not working.
- Regression now uses a non-stratified split for cross validation, a stratified
  split is not possible and thus gave errors.
- There was a bug that the coliage features where always computed, which
  is now fixed.
