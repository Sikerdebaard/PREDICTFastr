Description: # PREDICT v1.0.0
        
        ## PREDICT: a Radiomics Extensive Differentiable Interchangable Classification Toolkit
        
        This is an open-source python package supporting Radiomics medical image feature extraction and classification.
        
        We aim to add a wide variety of features and classifiers to address a wide variety classification problems.
        Through a modular setup, these can easily be interchanged and compared.
        
        
        ### Documentation
        
        For more information, see the sphinx generated documentation available [here](http://predict.readthedocs.io/).
        
        Alternatively, you can generate the documentation by checking out the master branch and running from the root directory:
        
            python setup.py build_sphinx
        
        The documentation can then be viewed in a browser by opening `PACKAGE_ROOT\build\sphinx\html\index.html`.
        
        ### Installation
        
        PREDICT has currently only been tested on Unix with Python 2.7.
        The package can be installed through pip:
        
              pip install PREDICT
        
        #### FASTR tools
        When running the FASTR package under version 1.3.0, you need to manually add the PREDICT fastr_tools path to the FASTR tools path. Go the your FASTR config file (default: ~/.fastr/config.py) and add the fastr_tools path analogue to the description in the PREDICT/fastrconfig/PREDICT_config.py file.
        
        ### 3rd-party packages used in PREDICT:
        We mainly rely on the following packages:
        
         - SimpleITK (Image loading and preprocessing)
         - numpy (Feature computation)
         - sklearn, scipy (Classification)
         - FASTR (Fast and parallel workflow execution)
         - pandas (Storage)
        
        See also the [requirements file](requirements.txt).
        
        ### WIP
        - We are working on improving the documentation.
        - We are working on the addition of different classifiers.
        - Examples and unit tests will be added.
